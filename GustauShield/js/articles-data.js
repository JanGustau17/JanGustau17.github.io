    dashboardSummary: "AI is helping cybersecurity teams spot threats fast and fix security holes before hackers can use them.",
    mainContentHtml: `
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how we protect computer systems by using smart software to find and stop dangers.</p>
        <p>AI already powers antivirus tools, watches for hackers with machine learning, and finds hidden threats quickly.</p>
        <h4>Current Uses of AI in Cybersecurity</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Threat Detection: AI scans data to spot attacks before they happen.</li>
            <li>Vulnerability Management: It checks code to find and fix security holes.</li>
            <li>Malware Analysis: AI studies bad software behavior to help teams respond fast.</li>
            <li>User Authentication: It looks at typing and behavior to confirm identities.</li>
            <li>Password Management: AI finds weak passwords and warns users to update them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Challenges and Concerns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>AI systems can be attacked and used to do harm if theyâ€™re not secure.</li>
            <li>It can be hard to know why AI makes certain choices (lack of transparency).</li>
            <li>AI can be biased if it learns from unfair or incomplete data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Looking ahead, AI may work with blockchain and connected devices (IoT) for stronger security. When used responsibly, AI helps protect data and networks better than ever.</p>

    dashboardSummary: "Attackers now use AI to scale highly convincing attacks, so defenders must match them with AI-driven defenses guided by human expertise.",
    mainContentHtml: `
        <p>Cybersecurity constantly evolves because attackers are using AI to innovate their methods.</p>
        <p>Legacy security tools often struggle to keep up with the speed and scale of AI-driven threats.</p>
        <p>Last year, GenAI was mostly for consumers, but now big companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta have integrated it into enterprise software.</p>
        <p>Attackers use AI to craft flawless phishing emails, mimic user behavior, and bypass multi-factor authentication.</p>
        <p>As attackers automate their campaigns, security teams must also automate defenses using AI to detect unusual patterns across cloud, network, and endpoints.</p>
        <p>AI-driven defense tools can triage alerts, correlate signals, and prioritize real threats for SOC analysts.</p>
        <p>With AI assistance, defenders can investigate, isolate, and contain attacks at machine speed.</p>
        <p>However, AI systems need expert human oversight to manage biases and ensure models use the right techniques.</p>
        <p>Choosing the correct AI method for each security task is crucial for efficient threat detection and response.</p>
        <p>By combining human expertise with AI power, organizations can protect themselves in the age of AI versus AI.</p>
        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>AI enables attackers to scale highly convincing attacks like phishing.</li>
            <li>Defenders need AI to match the speed and complexity of AI-driven threats.</li>
            <li>AI tools help SOC teams triage, correlate, and prioritize real threats.</li>
            <li>Human oversight is essential to guide AI and prevent bias.</li>
            <li>Select the right AI technique for each security task.</li>
        </ul>
